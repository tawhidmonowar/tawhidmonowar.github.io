title: Swift Introduction
description: Swift is
a modern, high-performance programming language developed by Apple for creating iOS, macOS, watchOS, and tvOS apps, known for its safety, speed, and clean syntax. Introduced in 2014, it replaces Objective-C, offering features like automatic memory management, optionals, and seamless interoperability.

## 1. Basic Data Types

```swift
let age: Int = 25
let price: Double = 19.99
let isActive: Bool = true
let name: String = "Swift"
```

### Collections

```swift
let numbers = [1, 2, 3]                  // Array
let uniqueNumbers = Set([1, 2, 3])       // Set
let user = ["id": 1, "name": "John"]     // Dictionary
```

---

## 2. Constants vs Variables

- `let` → Constant (cannot change)
- `var` → Variable (can change)

```swift
let maxLoginAttempts = 10
var currentLoginAttempt = 0
currentLoginAttempt += 1
```

---

## 3. Type Inference

Swift automatically detects types:

```swift
let count = 42        // Int
let pi = 3.14159      // Double
```

Explicit type declaration:

```swift
var message: String
message = "Hello"
```

---

## 4. Optionals (Handling Missing Values)

Optionals represent values that may or may not exist.

```swift
var possibleNumber: Int? = 123
possibleNumber = nil
```

### Optional Binding

```swift
if let number = possibleNumber {
    print(number)
}
```

### Default Value with `??`

```swift
let name: String? = nil
let greeting = "Hello, " + (name ?? "Guest")
```

---

## 5. Tuples (Multiple Values)

```swift
let httpError = (404, "Not Found")
print(httpError.0)  // 404
```

Named tuple:

```swift
let status = (code: 200, message: "OK")
print(status.code)
```

---

## 6. Type Safety & Conversion

Swift prevents mixing incompatible types:

```swift
let number = 3
let decimal = 0.14
let result = Double(number) + decimal
```

Explicit conversion is required.

---

## 7. Assertions & Preconditions

Assertion (debug only):

```swift
let age = -1
assert(age >= 0, "Age cannot be negative")
```

Precondition (checked in production):

```swift
precondition(age >= 0, "Invalid age")
```

---

## 8. Error Handling

```swift
func makeSandwich() throws {
    // may throw error
}

do {
    try makeSandwich()
} catch {
    print("An error occurred")
}
```

---

## Key Takeaways

- Use `let` by default.
- Swift is strongly typed and safe.
- Optionals prevent null-related crashes.
- Explicit type conversion avoids hidden bugs.
- Assertions help catch mistakes early.
