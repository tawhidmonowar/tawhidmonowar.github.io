## Activities 

In Android, an `Activity` is a single screen that users interact with in an app. It serves as a container for the user interface and handles user actions. Each activity has a lifecycle (e.g., `onCreate()`, `onResume()`, `onDestroy()`) that manages how it behaves as the user navigates the app. While older apps use multiple activities for different screens, modern apps often use a single activity with multiple composables or fragments for navigation.

## Activity Lifecycle

The Activity Lifecycle in Android describes how an activity changes states during its existence. Key lifecycle methods include `onCreate()`, `onStart()`, `onResume()`, `onPause()`, `onStop()`, and `onDestroy()`. These methods are called by the system as the activity is created, becomes visible, interacts with the user, or is closed. Managing these states properly helps ensure smooth performance and efficient resource usage. (See diagram below for the lifecycle flow.)
