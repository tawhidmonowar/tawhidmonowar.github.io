## Prefix Sum

A prefix sum array, also known as a cumulative sum array, is a derived array that stores the cumulative sum of elements in a given array. Each element in the prefix sum array represents the sum of all elements up to that index in the original array. It acts as a precursor to answering queries related to cumulative sums, allowing for fast and efficient computations.

## Two Pointers

In the two pointers method, two pointers are used to iterate through the array values. Both pointers can move to one direction only, which ensures that the algorithm works efficiently.
