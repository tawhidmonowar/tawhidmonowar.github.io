## Introduction

### Artificial Intelligence (AI):  
AI is the science of making machines think and act like humans. It includes things like decision-making, language understanding, and problem-solving.

### Machine Learning (ML):  
ML is a part of AI where machines learn from data and get better over time without being directly programmed.

### Deep Learning (DL):  
DL is a type of ML that uses neural networks to handle complex tasks like image recognition, speech, and language translation.

### Computer Vision (CV): 
Computer Vision is a field of AI that enables machines to see, understand, and interpret images or videos like humans. It’s used in things like facial recognition, object detection, and medical image analysis.

### Natural Language Processing (NLP):  
NLP is a branch of AI that helps machines understand, interpret, and generate human language. It’s used in chatbots, translation apps, speech recognition, and sentiment analysis.

### Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR):  
ASR is a technology that converts spoken language into written text. It’s used in voice assistants, transcription services, and voice commands in apps and devices.

## Supervised Learning  
Supervised Learning is a type of machine learning where the model is trained on `labeled data`, meaning the input comes with the correct output. It learns to make predictions or classifications based on that. It's used in tasks like spam detection, image classification, and loan approval.

### Regression:
Regression is a type of supervised learning used to predict continuous values, like prices, temperatures, or sales. It finds the relationship between input features and a numerical output. For example, predicting house prices based on size and location.

### Classification:  
Classification is a type of supervised learning that assigns input data into categories or classes. For example, sorting emails into “spam” or “not spam,” or recognizing handwritten digits as numbers from 0 to 9.

## Unsupervised Learning  
Unsupervised Learning is a type of machine learning where the model learns patterns from unlabeled data without specific answers. It’s used for grouping similar data (clustering) or reducing data dimensions, like customer segmentation or topic discovery.

### Clustering:  
Clustering is an unsupervised learning technique that groups similar data points together based on their features. It’s used to find patterns or segments in data, like grouping customers by buying behavior or organizing photos by similarity.

## Reinforcement Learning (RL)  
Reinforcement Learning is a type of machine learning where an agent learns by interacting with an environment and receiving rewards or penalties. It’s used in game-playing AIs, robotics, and self-driving cars to make decisions and improve performance over time.
