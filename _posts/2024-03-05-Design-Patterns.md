title: Design Patterns
description: A design pattern is a reusable solution to common problems in software development. There are different types of design patterns, such as creational patterns, which focus on how objects are created and ensure efficient and controlled creation, and architectural patterns, which define the overall structure and organization of an application to improve maintainability and scalability.

## Architectural Design Patterns

### MVVM (Model–View–ViewModel)

MVVM is a design pattern that separates UI (View), business logic (ViewModel), and data (Model). It is widely used in Android. MVVM is an architectural pattern that divides an application into three core components:

- **Model**: This layer represents the data of your application. It interacts with data sources like databases or network APIs.
- **View**: This layer handles the user interface (UI) elements and their layout. It displays data to the user and captures user interactions.
- **ViewModel**: This layer acts as the intermediary between the Model and the View. It prepares the data for the View in a consumable way, handles business logic, and exposes observable data streams to the View.
