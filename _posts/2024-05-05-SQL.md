## Basics

### Comments

We use comments to add notes to our code.

```sql
—- This is a comment and it won’t get executed.
```

### SELECT Clause

```sql
—- Using expressions
SELECT (points * 10 + 20) AS discount_factor
FROM customers

—- Removing duplicates
SELECT DISTINCT state
FROM customers
```
Order of operations:
- Parenthesis
- Multiplication / division
- Addition / subtraction

### WHERE Clause

We use the `WHERE `clause to filter data.

Comparison operators:
- Greater than: >
- Greater than or equal to: >=
- Less than: <
- Less than or equal to: <=
- Equal: =
- Not equal: <>
- Not equal: !=

### Logical Operators

```sql
—- AND (both conditions must be True)
SELECT *
FROM customers
WHERE birthdate > ‘1990-01-01’ AND points > 1000

—- OR (at least one condition must be True)
SELECT *
FROM customers
WHERE birthdate > ‘1990-01-01’ OR points > 1000

—- NOT (to negate a condition)
SELECT *
FROM customers
WHERE NOT (birthdate > ‘1990-01-01’)
```

### IN Operator

```sql
—- Returns customers in any of these states: VA, NY, CA
SELECT *
FROM customers
WHERE state IN (‘VA’, ‘NY’, ‘CA’)
```

### BETWEEN Operator

```sql
SELECT *
FROM customers
WHERE points BETWEEN 100 AND 200
```


### LIKE Operator

```sql
—- Returns customers whose first name starts with b
SELECT *
FROM customers
WHERE first_name LIKE ‘b%’
```
- `%`: any number of characters
- `_`: exactly one character

### REGEXP Operator

```sql
—- Returns customers whose first name starts with a
SELECT *
FROM customers
WHERE first_name REGEXP ‘^a’
```
- `^`: beginning of a string
- `$`: end of a string
- `|`: logical OR
- `[abc]`: match any single characters
- `[a-d]`: any characters from a to d

Examples

```sql
—- Returns customers whose first name ends with EY or ON
WHERE first_name REGEXP ‘ey$|on$’

—- Returns customers whose first name starts with MY
—- or contains SE
WHERE first_name REGEXP ‘^my|se’

—- Returns customers whose first name contains B followed by
—- R or U
WHERE first_name REGEXP ‘b[ru]’
```

### IS NULL Operator

```sql
—- Returns customers who don’t have a phone number
SELECT *
FROM customers
WHERE phone IS NULL
```

### ORDER BY Clause

```sql
—- Sort customers by state (in ascending order), and then
—- by their first name (in descending order)
SELECT *
FROM customers
ORDER BY state, first_name DESC
```

### LIMIT Clause

```sql 
—- Return only 3 customers
SELECT *
FROM customers
LIMIT 3

—- Skip 6 customers and return 3
SELECT *
FROM customers
LIMIT 6, 3
```

### Inner Joins

```sql
SELECT *
FROM customers c
JOIN orders o
ON c.customer_id = o.customer_id
```

### Outer Joins

```sql
—- Return all customers whether they have any orders or not
SELECT *
FROM customers c
LEFT JOIN orders o
ON c.customer_id = o.customer_id
```
### USING Clause

If column names are exactly the same, you can simplify the join with the `USING` clause.

```sql
SELECT *
FROM customers c
JOIN orders o
USING (customer_id)
```

### Cross Joins

```sql
—- Combine every color with every size
SELECT *
FROM colors
CROSS JOIN sizes
```

### Unions

```sql
—- Combine records from multiple result sets
SELECT name, address
FROM customers
UNION
SELECT name, address
FROM clients
```

### Inserting Data

```sql
—- Insert a single record
INSERT INTO customers(first_name, phone, points)
VALUES (‘Mosh’, NULL, DEFAULT)

—- Insert multiple single records
INSERT INTO customers(first_name, phone, points)
VALUES
(‘Mosh’, NULL, DEFAULT),
(‘Bob’, ‘1234’, 10)
```

### RANK()

The RANK() function in MySQL is a window function used to assign a rank to each row within a partition of a result set. Ranks are assigned based on the ORDER BY clause, and ties (duplicate values) receive the same rank — but gaps appear in the ranking after duplicates.

```sql
RANK() OVER (
  [PARTITION BY partition_expression]
  ORDER BY sort_expression [ASC|DESC]
)
```

### DENSE_RANK() 

The `DENSE_RANK()` function is a window function in MySQL used to assign ranks to rows without gaps, even if there are ties (duplicate values in the ordering column).

```sql
DENSE_RANK() OVER (
  [PARTITION BY partition_expression]
  ORDER BY sort_expression [ASC|DESC]
)
```
Example:

```sql
SELECT score, DENSE_RANK() OVER (ORDER BY score DESC) AS rank
FROM Scores;
```

This query retrieves all scores from the Scores table and assigns each one a rank based on its value using the `DENSE_RANK()` window function.
